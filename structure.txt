TODO:

1. Make sure that there is a singular file (main) that the demonstrator should 
    run. This file needs to be very short, and have minimal function definitions 
    inside. The only functions that are defined in here are the ones that are 
    being run. So a function defined part_one(...) which outputs all the answers
    to part 1 is acceptable. This will mean the instructor doesn't have to run
    any code blocks and can just comment out part_two if he just wants to see 
    part_one.

    Example:

    part_one(input):
        stuff = transform(input)
        output_graph(stuff)
        final_answer = calculate(stuff)
        print(final_answer)
        return final_answer

    part_two(input):
        stuff = transform2(input)
        output_graph2(stuff)
        final_answer = calculate2(stuff)
        print(final_answer)
        return final_answer

    part_one(input1)
    part_two(input2)

2. If possible, different questions/functionality should be split into different 
    files. So any graph outputting function should be in its own file, separate
    from any calculation functions. (This is not mandatory though)
    It will help with code cleanliness.

3. The only thing inside files that are not your main file are
    function declarations. Do not call any functions inside files that are not
    main except inside function declarations.


comparing the grad and quasi newton method - does second derivative give us
more information about the physics or efficiency is also very important
